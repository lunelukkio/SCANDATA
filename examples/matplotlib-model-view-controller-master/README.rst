matplotlib-model-view-controller
********************************

A small demo of a tkinter science-y application that follows a model-view-controller design pattern.

The examples of python model-view-controller I have found in books and online differ in structure, and many include model, view, and controller all in one script. So, I combined their strategies and created my own demo. This exercise helped me prepare for a MVC refactor on a much larger tkinter application.

The example has been updated for matplotlib v3.

Feedback
========

The author is not a professional programmer. I've tried to provide a proper MVC structure and to follow best practices such as PEP 8. I hope that this project may help others wanting to construct MVC applications with matplotlib. Questions, corrections, comments, suggested improvements and any other feedback are welcome.
